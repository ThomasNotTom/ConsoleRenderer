<h1>ConsoleRenderer</h1>
<h3><b>notes:</b></h3>
<ul>
    <li>This code has been written with functionality in mind, over readability. Therefore many standard programming practices such as comments and consistent variable naming conventions have not been followed, in some cases</li>
    <li>The sprite can be of any size, shape and characters. This is all altered from "main.cpp". "n" denotes a new line</li>
    <li>The movement controls are the arrow keys.</li>

</ul>

The code is written in C++.

The entrance point is "main.cpp"
